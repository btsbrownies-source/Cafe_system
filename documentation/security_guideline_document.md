# Security Guidelines for Cafe_system

This document outlines security best practices and requirements tailored to the `Cafe_system` repository. It applies core security principles—Security by Design, Least Privilege, Defense in Depth, and Fail Securely—to every layer of the application. Integrate these controls early and continuously throughout development, testing, and deployment.

## 1. Security by Design

- Embed security reviews in architecture and design phases.  
- Define threat models for each major module (Order Management, Inventory Control, POS, Reporting).  
- Use user stories to capture security requirements (e.g., MFA for administrative roles).

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1 Robust Authentication
- Enforce strong password policies: minimum 12 characters, complexity rules, blacklist check.  
- Use bcrypt or Argon2 with unique salts for password hashing.  
- Store session identifiers in `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Strict` cookies.  
- Implement idle and absolute session timeouts (e.g., 15 min idle, 8 h absolute).

### 2.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Require MFA for manager and admin roles.  
- Support time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or hardware tokens.

### 2.3 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Define roles: `Customer`, `Clerk`, `Manager`, `Administrator`.  
- Map operations (create order, adjust inventory, view analytics) to least-privilege roles.  
- Enforce server-side authorization checks on every endpoint.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

- Treat all inputs as untrusted: menu items, order modifiers, customer profile data.  
- Use parameterized queries or ORM prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.  
- Validate file uploads (e.g., profile pictures): enforce allow-list of MIME types, max size, scan for malware.  
- Apply context-aware encoding on output (HTML, JSON) to mitigate XSS.  
- Sanitize dynamic template variables to prevent template injection.

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

### 4.1 Encryption in Transit & at Rest
- Enforce HTTPS/TLS 1.2+ for all web and API traffic.  
- Use HSTS header (`Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`).  
- Encrypt sensitive database fields (customer PII, payment details) using AES-256.

### 4.2 Secrets Management
- Store API keys, database credentials in a secrets manager (e.g., Vault).  
- Do not check secrets into version control or `README.md`.

### 4.3 Information Leakage
- Return generic error messages in production (avoid stack traces).  
- Mask PII in logs; implement structured logging with redaction rules.

## 5. API & Service Security

- Enforce HTTPS and reject plain HTTP.  
- Implement rate limiting per IP and per endpoint (e.g., 100 req/minute).  
- Validate CORS policy: allow only trusted origins (e.g., POS frontend domain).  
- Use proper HTTP verbs: GET for retrieval, POST for create, PUT/PATCH for update, DELETE for removal.  
- Version APIs (e.g., `/api/v1/orders`) to control breaking changes.

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

- Enable and configure security headers:  
  - `Content-Security-Policy`: restrict script and frame sources.  
  - `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.  
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `frame-ancestors 'none'` in CSP.  
  - `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`.
- Protect state-changing forms with CSRF tokens.  
- Avoid storing sensitive tokens in localStorage; use secure cookies.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

- Harden OS and container images: disable unnecessary services, apply latest patches.  
- Rotate default credentials; enforce strong admin passwords.  
- Expose only necessary ports (e.g., 443 for HTTPS, 5432 for DB on internal network).  
- Disable debug modes and verbose logs in production builds.

## 8. Dependency Management

- Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `Pipfile.lock`) to freeze dependency versions.  
- Integrate SCA tools (e.g., Dependabot, Snyk) in CI to detect CVEs.  
- Regularly audit and update third-party libraries, removing unused packages.

## 9. CodeGuide Integration

- Extend CodeGuide rules to include security linters (e.g., ESLint plugin security, Bandit for Python).  
- Fail CI builds on critical security issues; enforce code reviews for security-related changes.

## 10. Ongoing Security Practices

- Conduct periodic threat assessments and penetration tests.  
- Schedule automated security scans (SAST, DAST) as part of CI/CD pipelines.  
- Establish an incident response plan and maintain audit logs for key events (login attempts, role changes, payment processing).  

Adherence to these guidelines will help ensure the `Cafe_system` is built with security at its core, minimizing risks and protecting customer data throughout the application lifecycle.
