# Tech Stack Document for Cafe_system

This document explains, in simple terms, the technology choices for the Cafe_system project. It’s designed so that anyone—technical or not—can understand why we picked each tool and how they work together.

## 1. Frontend Technologies
The frontend is what your staff or customers will see and interact with, like menus, buttons, and forms.

- **React**
  - A popular library for building user interfaces.
  - Lets us create reusable components (for example, a menu item card) to keep the code organized and consistent.
  - Improves the user experience by updating only the parts of the page that change (fast and smooth).

- **Tailwind CSS**
  - A utility-first styling tool that simplifies design by letting us apply small, reusable style classes directly in the HTML.
  - Speeds up the styling process, ensuring a clean and modern look without writing lots of custom CSS.

- **React Router**
  - Manages navigation between different pages (like the order screen, inventory dashboard, or reports) without reloading the entire page.
  - Keeps the app feeling fast and app-like.

- **Formik & Yup**
  - Formik handles form state (like order forms or login forms) so we don’t have to manage every detail ourselves.
  - Yup provides simple, readable rules for validating user input (for example, ensuring a credit card number is entered correctly).

## 2. Backend Technologies
The backend is the engine under the hood—it stores data, runs business logic, and talks with the frontend.

- **Node.js with Express**
  - A JavaScript-based server environment (Node.js) and a lightweight framework (Express) for handling requests from the frontend.
  - Allows quick development of RESTful APIs (endpoints that the frontend calls to create orders, fetch inventory, etc.).

- **PostgreSQL**
  - A reliable, open-source relational database for storing structured data:
    - Orders, menu items, inventory levels, customer profiles, and transaction history.
  - Strong support for complex queries, ensuring we can generate reports and analytics easily.

- **Prisma ORM**
  - A tool that helps us interact with PostgreSQL using simple JavaScript/TypeScript code instead of raw SQL.
  - Improves developer productivity and reduces the chance of database errors.

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - A secure way to manage user sessions (who is logged in) without storing session data on the server.
  - Keeps each request authenticated and prevents unauthorized access.

## 3. Infrastructure and Deployment
These tools handle where and how the code runs, ensuring reliability and easy updates.

- **GitHub & Git**
  - Version control system (Git) hosted on GitHub.
  - Tracks every code change, enables collaboration, and serves as the single source of truth for the project.

- **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**
  - Automates testing and deployment pipelines:
    - Runs code quality checks using CodeGuide.
    - Executes automated tests whenever new code is pushed.
    - Deploys to production or staging environments if all checks pass.

- **Docker**
  - Packages the application and its dependencies into containers.
  - Ensures that the app runs the same way on any machine (developer laptop, testing server, or cloud).

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**
  - **Elastic Beanstalk** or **EC2** for hosting the backend and database.
  - **S3** for storing static assets (images, reports) and backups.
  - Enables automatic scaling to handle busy times (like peak coffee hours).

## 4. Third-Party Integrations
These services plug into the system to add specialized features without building everything from scratch.

- **Stripe**
  - Processes credit card and digital wallet payments securely.
  - Handles recurring billing and stores customer payment details in a PCI-compliant way.

- **Google Analytics**
  - Provides insights into how users interact with any public or staff-facing dashboards.
  - Helps managers understand peak times, popular menu items, and usage patterns.

- **CodeGuide**
  - Runs static analysis, linting, and formatting checks on every pull request.
  - Enforces consistent code style and catches potential issues early.

- **SendGrid (or similar)**
  - Sends email notifications (order receipts, low-stock alerts, promotion announcements).
  - Ensures high delivery rates and manages email templates.

## 5. Security and Performance Considerations
Ensuring data is safe and the app runs smoothly, even under load.

- **HTTPS Everywhere**
  - All data between the client and server is encrypted in transit.

- **Helmet & Rate Limiting**
  - Helmet (an Express middleware) adds security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
  - Rate limiting prevents abuse by limiting repeated requests from the same user or IP.

- **Data Encryption**
  - Sensitive user data (passwords, payment info) is encrypted at rest and in transit.
  - PostgreSQL built-in encryption and AWS-managed encryption keys for backups.

- **Caching with Redis**
  - Stores frequently accessed data (like menu details or daily sales summary) in memory for quick retrieval.
  - Reduces database load and improves response times.

- **Monitoring & Alerting**
  - Tools like AWS CloudWatch or Datadog track server health, error rates, and performance.
  - Automated alerts notify the team if anything goes wrong (high error rates, CPU spikes).

## 6. Conclusion and Overall Tech Stack Summary
All these technologies were chosen to meet the Cafe_system’s goals:

- **User-Friendly Interface** with React and Tailwind CSS for fast, consistent design.
- **Robust Data Management** via Node.js/Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.
- **Reliable Operations** ensured by Docker, AWS, and automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Scalability & Security** through HTTPS, JWT, encryption, rate limiting, and caching.
- **Rich Functionality** by integrating with Stripe for payments, SendGrid for emails, and Google Analytics for insights.
- **High Code Quality** from day one with CodeGuide.

Together, this tech stack provides a solid foundation for building, deploying, and maintaining a modern café management system that can grow as your business grows.
